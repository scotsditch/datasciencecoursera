Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the course project.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code needs all the data to be in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to performed. 

The output of the 5th step is an example of tidy data called `ave_tidy_data.txt`.
